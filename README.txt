# Redjit - Reddit clone in Django

After several weeks of learning python and Django, I figured it would be better 
if I actually did something with that knowledge. Reddit is pretty popular, and
has a fairly clear-cut features, so it serves as a good project to work on.

I aim to emulate Reddit fairly closely (but not exactly), without following any 
tutorials (a quick search suggests there aren't any anyway). I also don't intend
to host this publicly.
